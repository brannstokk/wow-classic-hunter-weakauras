## Hunter Raid Reminders

![Preview](/img/hunter-raid-reminders.png?raw=true)

Reminds you with a glowing icon if:

- Elixir of the Mongoose buff is missing
- Scorpok Assay buff is missing
- Grilled Squid buff is missing
- Rumsey Rum Black Label/Gordok Green Grog buff is missing
- Thorium Shells/Arrows, Doomshot, or Miniature Cannon Balls are not equipped
- Lok'delar is equipped but missing a Dense Weightstone
- Greater Fire Protection Potion buff is active

The goal is to see none of the icons, except perhaps the reminder that
you have a GFPP active.

TODO: More weapon and weapon enhancement reminders (e.g. Ashkandi
equipped, but missing Elemental Sharpening Stone), but the above are
what is relevant to me at the moment.  Modify to taste.
